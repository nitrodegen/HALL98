8bit CPU in Verilog with basic stuff.


<h1>Specifications</h1>
32bit registers (H,A,L,N)<br>
16bit Instruction Pointer (P)<br>
100MHZ Speed

<h1>Instructions: </h1>
MOV (works with numbers and registers)
<br>
ADD (works only with registers (to lazy to add more) ) 
<br>
SUB (works only with registers (to lazy to add more) )
<br>
MUL (works only with registers (to lazy to add more) )

<h1>Why? </h1>
I'm currently doing geohot's course ,so I somehow need to learn this stuff.
<br>
And today I think I finally connected the dots on how CPU emulators work in Verilog.
<br>
Basically everything is the same as let's say, building emulators in C++ , just harder and more hardware specific.
